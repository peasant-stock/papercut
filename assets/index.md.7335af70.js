However, we run into issues when the user has a gmail (or a vanity email provided by gmail) as the \u201Cprimary email\u201D in their Papercut account.</p><p>Because the scan is sent \u201Cfrom\u201D the primary email, gmail thinks someone is trying to impersonate the user and blocks the email.</p><p><strong>The quickest and most direct fix</strong> for this issue is to simply <strong>delete the primary email</strong> (shown below) in the <a href="http://10.0.0.200:9191/admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Papercut Admin Portal</a>. Then, the scan will be sent \u201Cfrom\u201D the office email, instead of the user\u2019s own email, which looks perfectly legit to gmail.</p><p>Just make sure that the <strong>agent\u2019s email is in the printer\u2019s address book</strong> \u2013 if it\u2019s not, add it (photos below show how).</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="User&#39;s primary email field, shown in Papercut Admin Portal"> ^ Delete the primary email, then scroll down and click &quot;Apply&quot; to save.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The other option to fix this issue is to change the agent\u2019s primary email to their Windermere email, so that the scan is sent from their Windermere email. If they use the \u201CMe\u201D quick destination to send to, it will be sent to their Windermere email, so you need to make sure their Windermere email is forwarding to their gmail/vanity email.
