The easiest way to visit the <a href="http://10.0.0.200:9191/admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Papercut Admin Portal</a>, select “users” on the left, search the user and click on their account. Click on “Job Log” and find the job to be refunded, then click “refund” on the job. <img src="'+o+'" alt="User search in Papercut Admin Portal"></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="User&#39;s job log in Papercut Admin Portal"></p><p>This process refunds the entire job. <strong>If you need to do a partial refund</strong>, click “edit” (under “refund”), subtract the number of pages you want to refund from number of <strong>color pages</strong>, and edit the color pages field to reflect this new total.</p><p>You can update the cost field as well, but note that <strong>dollar amounts in Papercut are not used to calculate print charges on agent statements</strong>. The reports are done entirely from <strong>color page counts</strong>, so if you need to make any edits, make sure you are always updating the number of color pages.</p><h2 id="scanning-issues-with-email-delivery" tabindex="-1">Scanning - Issues with Email Delivery <a class="header-anchor" href="#scanning-issues-with-email-delivery" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scanning - Issues with Email Delivery&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For most users, the easiest way to scan to themselves is to select the “Me” quick destination on the main Scan page on the printer. However, we run into issues when the user has a gmail (or a vanity email provided by gmail) as the “primary email” in their Papercut account.</p><p>Because the scan is sent “from” the primary email, gmail thinks someone is trying to impersonate the user and blocks the email.</p><p><strong>The quickest and most direct fix</strong> for this issue is to simply <strong>delete the primary email</strong> (shown below) in the <a href="http://10.0.0.200:9191/admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Papercut Admin Portal</a>. Then, the scan will be sent “from” the office email, instead of the user’s own email, which looks perfectly legit to gmail.</p><p>Just make sure that the <strong>agent’s email is in the printer’s address book</strong> – if it’s not, add it (photos below show how).</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="User&#39;s primary email field, shown in Papercut Admin Portal"> ^ Delete the primary email, then scroll down and click &quot;Apply&quot; to save.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The other option to fix this issue is to change the agent’s primary email to their Windermere email, so that the scan is sent from their Windermere email. If they use the “Me” quick destination to send to, it will be sent to their Windermere email, so you need to make sure their Windermere email is forwarding to their gmail/vanity email. You can email <a href="mailto:emailsupport@windermere.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">emailsupport@windermere.com</a> to check/set this for you, if the agent is unable to get into their Windermere email themselves.</p></div><h4 id="to-add-agent-s-email-to-the-address-book-on-the-printer" tabindex="-1">To add agent&#39;s email to the address book on the printer: <a class="header-anchor" href="#to-add-agent-s-email-to-the-address-book-on-the-printer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;To add agent&#39;s email to the address book on the printer:&quot;">​</a></h4><ol><li><p>Tap &quot;Scan&quot;</p></li><li><p>Tap &quot;Addr.
